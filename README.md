# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This is my repository for my HTML and CSS projects.
My projects include the Space Station Site and the Movie Theatre Site.
The Space Station Site is an example home page for a space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.
The Movie Theatre Site is an example home page for a movie theatre that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
